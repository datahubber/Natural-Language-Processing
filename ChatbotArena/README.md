# Kaggle LLM competition  
This competition challenges you to predict which responses users will prefer in a head-to-head battle between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). You'll be given a dataset of conversations from the Chatbot Arena, where different LLMs generate answers to user prompts. By developing a winning machine learning model, you'll help improve how chatbots interact with humans and ensure they better align with human preferences.

This is a followup to the first Human Preference Prediction competition, which focused on English conversations. This iteration will require working with conversations in many different languages.
