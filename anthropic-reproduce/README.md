# Anthropic Mechanistic Interpretability Reproduction

A comprehensive implementation of mechanistic interpretability analysis focusing on neural network activations and sparse autoencoders, reproducing and extending Anthropic's research.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project addresses the key questions in mechanistic interpretability:
- **What are activations?** - Neural network outputs that represent internal states
- **How to find activations on specific tokens?** - Using PyTorch hooks to extract activations
- **Purpose of Sparse Autoencoders (SAE)?** - Feature extraction and monosemanticity analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- M2 Mac (for MPS acceleration) or any machine with PyTorch support

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd anthropic-reproduce

# Set up environment
chmod +x setup_local.sh
./setup_local.sh
