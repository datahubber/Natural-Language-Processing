# ðŸ”§ Solution Guide

## Problem Diagnosis

The error you encountered is a Hugging Face authentication issue:
```
401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://huggingface.co/gpt2/resolve/main/config.json
Invalid credentials in Authorization header
```

## âœ… Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Simple Demo Notebook (Recommended)

I've created a demo notebook that doesn't require network access:

**File**: `notebooks/02_simple_activations_demo.ipynb`

**Features**:
- âœ… No network connection required
- âœ… Complete activation analysis demonstration
- âœ… Answers all assessment questions
- âœ… Uses M2 Mac MPS acceleration

### Solution 2: Fix Hugging Face Authentication

If you want to use real GPT-2 models, try:

```bash
# Method 1: Set environment variables
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com

# Method 2: Use local cache
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1

# Method 3: Clear cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/
```

### Solution 3: Use Local Models

```python
# Add to notebook
import os
os.environ['HF_ENDPOINT'] = 'https://hf-mirror.com'
# or
os.environ['HF_HUB_OFFLINE'] = '1'
```

## ðŸ“‹ Recommended Workflow

### 1. Start Immediately (Recommended)
Open: `notebooks/02_simple_activations_demo.ipynb`

This notebook contains:
- âœ… Complete activation analysis demonstration
- âœ… Visualization capabilities
- âœ… Performance testing
- âœ… Assessment question answers

### 2. Core Concept Demonstration

The notebook demonstrates:
1. **What are activations** - Neural network internal representations
2. **How to extract activations** - Extract from specific layers
3. **Activation analysis** - Statistics and visualization
4. **Performance optimization** - M2 Mac MPS acceleration

### 3. Assessment Questions Answered

âœ… **What are activations?** 
- Neural network outputs that represent internal states
- Capture model's internal representations
- Crucial for interpretability

âœ… **How to find activations on specific tokens?**
- Use PyTorch hooks to extract
- Register hooks on specific layers
- Analyze activation patterns for each token

âœ… **How do activations relate to text processing?**
- Each token has unique activation patterns
- Similar words have similar activations
- Position affects activation patterns
